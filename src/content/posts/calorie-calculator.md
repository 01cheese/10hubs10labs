# üß† AI Calorie Calculator

**AI Calorie Calculator** is a smart web app that identifies food from an uploaded image and returns its estimated calories and nutritional values. Built with FastAPI and HuggingFace Transformers, it uses a pre-trained image classification model trained on 101 food categories.

All core functionality is implemented in less than **300 lines of Python code**.

---

## Features

- Upload any food image (JPEG, PNG)
- AI model predicts food class (e.g., pizza, sushi, burger)
- Displays calories, protein, carbs, and fat
- Built with FastAPI and served as a web app
- Fully open source and easy to deploy

---

## How It Works

1. User uploads an image via the web interface.
2. The image is sent to the FastAPI backend.
3. A HuggingFace model (`nateraw/food`) processes the image.
4. The predicted label is matched with a JSON dataset of nutrition values.
5. Caloric and nutritional data is returned and displayed.

---

## Example Code (Backend)

```python
@app.post("/predict/")
async def predict_food(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    image_data = await file.read()
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_data)).convert("RGB")
    inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        logits = outputs.logits
        idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()
    label = labels[idx]
    nutrition = nutrition_data.get(label, {})
    return JSONResponse({
        "predicted_label": label,
        "nutrition": nutrition
    })
```

## Technologies Used

- FastAPI
- HuggingFace Transformers
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- JSON nutrition dataset
- Vanilla HTML + JS frontend
