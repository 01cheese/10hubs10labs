# âš¡ Lightning Generator

**Lightning Generator** is a minimalist visual project built with pure JavaScript. It generates realistic animated lightning bolts with branches and glow using HTML5 Canvas â€” in under 300 lines of code.

Perfect for:
- game intros or websites,
- visual effects,
- learning recursion and Canvas rendering.

---

## Features

- No libraries â€” just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Generates main bolt and random branches
- Glow and blur effects using Canvas
- Fully responsive to any screen size
- Auto-redraw every 2 seconds

---

## Algorithm: Midpoint Displacement

The core algorithm is recursive midpoint displacement of a line segment.

At each iteration:
- the segment is split in two;
- the midpoint is randomly displaced;
- the process continues until the segment is short enough.

Example function:

```js
function midpointDisplacement(x1, y1, x2, y2, offset, detail = [], midpoints = []) {
  const k = 1 + Math.random() * 3;
  if (offset < 2) {
    detail.push([x1, y1, x2, y2]);
  } else {
    const midX = (x1 + x2) / 2 + (Math.random() - 0.5) * offset * k;
    const midY = (y1 + y2) / 2 + (Math.random() - 0.5) * offset * k;
    midpoints.push([midX, midY]);
    midpointDisplacement(x1, y1, midX, midY, offset / 1.7, detail, midpoints);
    midpointDisplacement(midX, midY, x2, y2, offset / 1.7, detail, midpoints);
  }
  return { segments: detail, midpoints };
}
```

## Rendering Structure

The project draws several visual layers using Canvas:

- Main lightning bolt
- Branches emerging from corners
- Thin sub-branches
- Screen flash (semi-transparent white overlay)
