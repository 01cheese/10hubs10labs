# ðŸŽ† Fireworks Generator

**Fireworks Generator** is a beautiful, dynamic visual effect built with **pure JavaScript** and the **HTML5 Canvas API**. It simulates realistic fireworks explosions, with gravity, trails, colors, and different explosion types â€” all in under 300 lines of code.

Perfect for:
- Holiday projects and celebrations
- Interactive websites and intros
- Learning canvas animations and physics basics

---

## Features

- No libraries â€” just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Realistic gravity and friction-based physics
- Multiple explosion types: Ring, Sphere, Star, Fountain
- Bright color palettes: Warm, Cool, Pastel, Mono, Rainbow
- Adjustable particle count, auto-launch, and refresh rate
- Fully responsive to any screen size
- Control panel to tweak everything in real time

---

## How It Works

The animation is built from two classes:

- **Firework** â€” moves from bottom to target position, then explodes
- **Particle** â€” small fragments with velocity, color, fading and physics

When the firework reaches the target:
1. It generates multiple `Particle` objects based on the selected explosion type.
2. Each particle has its own velocity, friction, gravity, light, and lifetime.
3. A trail is rendered to simulate movement glow.

---

## Code Snapshot

Example of `Particle` physics logic:

```js
this.speed *= this.friction;
this.x += Math.cos(this.angle) * this.speed;
this.y += Math.sin(this.angle) * this.speed + this.gravity;
this.alpha -= this.decay;
```

The project uses `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth animation and frame-by-frame FPS calculation.

## Live Controls

You can interactively control:

- Auto-launch toggle
- Launch rate (ms)
- Particle count
- Explosion shape
- Color palette

A slick UI panel appears in the top right corner. You can collapse it to keep the screen clean.
